    <h1 class="display-4 text-center">Migrating to Github Pages and Jekyll</h1>
    <p class="lead">This website is currently using the free Github pages for hosting to see
        how well it works for a blog because many van lifers are living minimal life
        styles and may not want to pay for monthly web hosting for running a wordpress
        site.
        <br><br>
        If all goes well then I will create a training course on how to do it and 
        release a van life jekyll theme as that is the main part of jekyll that would
        be hard for non-technical people where as wordpress has lots of themes.

        It would mainly be the same as the theme that I am creating with the ability to 
        change the background image, fonts and colour scheme.
    </p>
    <hr class="m-4">
    <p class="text-center">The website's look and feel will be updated to look better over time as I
        build out the jekyll theme and the content for the site.
        <br>All content from old wordpress site has been migrated over with the correct dates on the posts.
